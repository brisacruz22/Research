# Research

I am an undergrad Peruvian student, currently, starting my seventh semester in Sociology. I am passionate about research in Social Sciences, particularly in the areas of human development, education, and extractive industries. I have decided to start sharing my work so I can receive feedback and maybe -who knows- help others with similar interests.

All the written content uploaded in this repository is owned by me (with its respectives bibliography references). Feel free to copy any code, but not so free copying my writing, unless you want to be sued for copyright infringement.

Que est√©s bien!!
